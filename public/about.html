<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Jarrell(ja-rell). I'm from a small town in Pennsylvania that is also the capital. I was born in late October making me a libra which explains a lot about my personality because I am all about balance.
  I currently live in SEA and have been for the past 7 years. I moved around a lot as a kid so it was only natural that travelling carried over into my adult life. I think longest I've spent in one location is 5 years.
  I acttually love picking up and starting over in new places because I always craved adventure thanks to my mom puttig me on Indiana Jones at such a young age so mix that with being a middle child and you have a  natural.
  born solo traveler.

<p>My hobbies are a little all over the place, I love technology and am a avid gamer but that doesn't mean I don't enjoy being outside in nature. I love going on hikes and camping whether by myself or with friends.
  My all time favorite activity is Rolleblading. This is the one thing that I cannot live without. When I'm happy I go skate, when I'm upset I go skate and sometimes hurt myself but no matter how I'm feeling skating 
  will always be my safe space. Thee interesting thing about me and skating is that I actually did not get back into it until I was 26 living inn Vietnam and haven't let up since. Skating has also allowed me to experience different counntries in
  a much different way that I will be forever grateful for. Prime example is that everyone whos been to Cambodia has been to Angkor Wat but how many people can say that they've skated the halfpipe and bowl under the giant M in the countryside of Siem Reap? Not to many I imagine.
  Another thing to know about me is my intense love for music. I've met so many people who claim to love "all types" of music but then can only identify a few genres. I literally have a favorite song from each every genre and favorite artists from almost every country. My all time favorite thing is 
  finding new music to skate to.

<p>As far as careers go Im still figuring out what I want to do with my life just like any other millenial but I've had plenty of different jobs and experiences throughout my life. The good thing about experiencing so many different fields is that it's helped me narrow things down a lot.
  If you were to ask me when I was young what did I want be when I grew up my answer would've been Indiana Jones or Taylor Swifts Bodyguard and the latter iis still true to this day but I understand how difficult that would be. I did attend school for criminal justice so I definitely know I'd like 
  a career that involes helping people. I do believe that cybersecurity may be the field for me because I have been trying self teach programming for quite some time but never quite knew what field I'd want to utilize it in. When I first starting learning I had aspirations of being a game developer but quickly
  realized that I really only want to make games as a hobby not a career. There has always been an underlying interest in hacking(Ethically of course) but I always believed that one needed to be a super genius for that but thanks to a bit of research I discovered that's not always the case.

<p>These are just a few things about me that cover the main bases so stay tuned to really get to know me, Welcome to my World. </p>
